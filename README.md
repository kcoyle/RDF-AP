# RDF-AP

This is ongoing work to modify the DC-Description Set Profile, taking into account the vocabularies of ShEx and SHACL.

## DSP vocabulary project
* [Proposed ontology](schemaList.csv) for profiles
* [Diagram](dspDiagram2.jpg) for this vocabulary
* [Diagram with rules](dspDiagram.jpg) proposes a possible way to include more complex rules within the profile
* [Comparison](BIBFRAMEcompare.csv) of the proposed vocabulary with other profile vocabularies, including DSP

## Background on project

[Patterns](Patterns.md) proposes a basic list of design patterns used for metadata description and validation.

[Requirements](requirements.md) is a list of requirements.

[Use cases](Use_cases.md) is a gathering of use cases relevant to the task.

[Description Set Profile - 2](DSPedited.md) is a re-writing of the DSP document.
