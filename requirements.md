# Requirments and motivation

Why? Who? What? How? Why do we want to create profiles? Who needs them? What functions do they need to provide? How will they work?

## Why?

### How can someone else understand your data well enough to make use of it?

Not unlike open source problem: you can declare your code ‘open’ and wish people ‘good luck’ or you can provide support.

### Variations 
#### on a standard
#### among partners
#### within a community
#### along a workflow
### Consensus building
#### makes decisions visible
#### can be used as a process
### Drive applications
### Drive user interfaces
#### input forms
#### displays
### Provide a framework for metadata development

## Who?
### Creators: anyone providing data
### Users
#### anyone who can/is allowed to access the data
#### both people AND machines - not an either/or, but should be both (? if not both, then people?)

## What?
### Basic structure of the data
#### the story that the data tells; what you are trying to say
#### what are the things? how are they described?
#### major things and minor things
#### anchors - what data anchors your dataset? (This is almost like unique keys in a dbms: what has to be there; what makes all other data useful)
### The CONTENT
#### subjects - properties - objects
#### things - attributes - values
### Things
#### How are things defined?
#### How are they described?
#### What is the relationship between things?
#### What things can stand alone?
### Properties, attributes, elements (use the one that makes most sense to you, assume they are the same)
#### What properties define the things? are required? 
#### What are the relationships between properties?
### Objects, values (same)
#### What is the value type or types for each property
#### what are/is the range of/ valid values
#### can values change? How?
#### what is the relationship between values (e.g. start date <= end date)
## How?
### markdown -> html
### wiki
### html with schema.org
